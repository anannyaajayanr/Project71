    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The project called Un fiore in mensa (A flower in canteen) was conceived by ATS (Agenzia di Tutela della Salute - Health Protection Agency) Val Padana as an acknowledgment given to the quality of the school catering service that could contribute to:

      improve the quality level of school catering service;
      stimulate teachers to live the meal at school as an educational moment;
      actively involve children by educating them in a healthy and correct diet;
      achieve childrens autonomy;
      stimulate local administrators, or private managers to achieve a common goal which is the psycho-physical well-being of children.
      The aim of the project is to assign an award – The Flower – on the basis of the evidences emerged from an inspection. The inspection should be performed at school (without any notice) by health personnel during lunch. Each room, tackle and food should be examined as well as the entire lunch (from preparation of meal to the consumption). </p>

    <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The attendance management system is a tool that keeps track of employee and student attendance in institutes. It gives complete data about the time the students are present in the institute and the time they take off. This process can be conducted by recording student and employee hours using online attendance software for your company.

      An attendance management system is used by an organization to track staff's time and attendance details. You can save time and effort by calculating your employee's working hours with an accurate attendance management system.
      
      A school attendance management system is a solution that conducts tracking, monitoring, and compiling daily student attendance data through an online medium. It enables the faculty to record and maintain 100% accurate student attendance reports, attendance history, absentee records, & other activities within a few clicks.</p>
